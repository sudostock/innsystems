# Brief outline of the PSO classes.

= PSO =

= Particles Class =

 * Previous position
 * Current position
  * (x,y,z) 3D Space
 * Velocity
  * (u,v,w) Vector
 * Fitness
  * Error, epochs
 * pBest
 * nBest
 * gBest
 * Previous error (?)
 * Neighborhood
  * number of particles

= Methods Class =

 * initialize positions and velocities
 * fitness function
  * calculate fitness using epochs, error
 * adjust Velocity
  * based on difference of fitnesses 
 * adjust Position
  * based on previous velocity
 * calculate best
  * calculate all the current bests
 * Max velocity thing
 * Assign neighbors
 *
